### CREATION DATE : JAN - 2020
The project was created Jan 2020 on the local machine.
This is my 2nd project from the Udacity "Data Analyst"
Nanodegree Program.

### _Analyze_A/B_Test_Results
For this project, I am working to understand the results of an A/B test run
by an e-commerce website.
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number
of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the
company's product.
My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if
they should implement this new page, keep the old page,
or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


### Description
We use probability, Hypothesis testing, Regression models to analyze and conclude,
which one (old or new) design of the page is better in terms of User Convertion
Rate (meaning the number of users who see the page and decide to pay for the
company's product).

#Part 1

    Probabilities

#Part 2

    A/B Test

#Part 3

    A Regression approach

#Part 4

    Conclusion

### Files used
